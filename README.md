# QuizWebPage
A module based web page through which a client can organize quiz based on any field and the competitor can analyze his/her answers instantaneously.

Introduction: 
A web application is a distributed application that runs on more than one computer and communicates through a network or a server. Specifically, a web application is accessed with a web browser as a client and provides the ability to update and maintain a program without deploying and installing software on client computers. Web applications are used for web mail, online retail sales, discussion boards, weblogs, online banking, among others. One advantage of a web application is that it can be accessed and used by millions of people at the same time. 

 Dynamic HTML (DHTML), extensible HTML (XHTML) and XML are some of the technologies that are part of today’s browsers to provide interactivity to web applications. Web servers have also been enhanced to respond to client’s requests in a more flexible way than presenting the same content to all users. Server-side scripting is the key technology that allows developers to make Web applications fit for a specific purpose, so incoming requests can be processed by the server on the fly.   

 With server-side scripting, web pages are prepared by the application (on the server) considering the client’s request. The information submitted to the client can be in HTML format, which is the Internet’s basic standardized language of communication. Several server-side technologies exist today. Examples are Active Server Pages (ASP or ASP.NET), Java Servlets and Java Server Pages (JSP), PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor), Perl and Python.   

 The idea of comparing various web application development tools and technologies has been an important consideration for many web application developers. While some researchers use these comparisons to decide which technologies and tools to adopt in developing new web applications others use them for developing new frameworks to simplify the web application development process.   

Objectives: 

 This paper compares web application development technologies using open-source software and proprietary software. The following are specific objectives that have been set to achieve the above aim. 

 To compare the major technological differences and similarities in web development technologies using open-source tools such as JSP and PHP and proprietary tools such as Python flask. 

 To explore the merits and demerits of using open-source software and proprietary software in web application development. 

To compare the performance of the various web development technologies on different platforms including mobile devices. 

 
Methodology: 

Web development Methodology is designed to help you take maximum advantage of the internet technologies. It incorporates all aspects related to your website and allows us to ensure that the final product is of the highest standards. 

Below are the steps we will take to ensure that all your deliverables are completed in time and within budget:

Work progress / plan & Implementation 

 HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap , different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. 

 When a browser displays a document, it must combine the document’s content with it’s style information. It processes the document in a number of stages, which is listed below. This is a very simplified version of what happens when a browser loads a webpage, and that different browsers will handle the process in different ways. The rough ways it happens are listed below 

1. The browser loads HTML (e.g., receives from network). 

2. It converts HTML into Document Object Model. The document Object Model represents the       document in the computer’s memory. 

3.The browser then fetches most of the resources that are linked to by the HTML document, such as embedded images and videos and linked CSS. 

4. The browser parses the fetched CSS and sorts the different rules by their selector types into different “buckets”, e.g., element, class, ID, and so on. Based on the selectors it finds, it works out which rules should be applied to which nodes in the DOM and attaches style to them as required (this intermediate step is called a render tree). 

5. The render tree is laid out in the structure it should appear in after the rules have been applied to it.
